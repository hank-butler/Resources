LINKED LIST
===========

Linking together nodes using next_node property craetes a singly
linked link.
Extremely versatile and useful.
Used as foundations for future data structures.

===================
Doubly Linked Lists
===================


Single linked list consists of nodes with links from one node to the next.
A doubly linked list has a link to the node before it.
prev_node links, along with the added tail_nail property, allow you to iterate
backward through the list as easily as you could iterate forward singly linked list.

======
Queues
======
A linear collection of nodes that exclusively asdds nodes to the tail
and removes nodes from the head of the queue.

Implemented using different underlying data structures, but more common method
is a singly linked list.

Think of like a line in a grocery store.

======
Stacks
======

Like a queue, a stack is a linear collection of nodes that adds (pushes) data to the head
of the stack. However, a stack removes data from the head of the stack. Think of like a stack of books.
